# workstation_setup

This repository provides tooling to set up a workstation running macOS with the necessary tools and configuration to start developing/working on systems in our customer-facing environments.

## What does this install

This repository includes a shell script that will install homebrew and other tools to set up your workstation.

## TODO

The shell script should be replaced with a simpler shell script that bootstraps the setup of Ansible and performs the setup locally which would be much more clean and easier for everyone involved.
